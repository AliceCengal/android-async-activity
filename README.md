Android AsyncActivity
=====================
*A small addon to mate android.app.Activity with scala.concurrent.Future*

An easy way to execute an asynchronous job in Scala is to wrap the procedure in a `scala.concurrent.Future`, and 
then do monadic transformation on the returned Future object.

```scala
val futureObject: Future[DomainObject] = Future {
  val jsonResponse = doNetworkCall();
  new DomainObject(jsonResponse)
}

futureObject
  .map(_.divisionId)
  .onComplete {
    case Success(id) => displayId(id)
    case Failure(ex) => displayError(ex)
  }
```

This approach would be really helpful in Android programming where fetching data from the server is done all the 
time. The problem is that the `onComplete` callback is not guaranteed to be run in the same thread that it is 
defined, which is a major problem if you want to update the UI based on the result of the async job.

The trait `AsyncActivity` provides an implicit conversion that adds methods to Future objects with `ForUi` suffix.

```scala
def onCompleteForUi[U](f: (Try[T]) â‡’ U)
                      (implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Unit

def onSuccessForUi[U](pf: PartialFunction[T, U])
                     (implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Unit

def onFailureForUi[U](pf: PartialFunction[Throwable, U])
                     (implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Unit
```

These methods are equivalent to the normal ones defined on scala.concurrent.Future, except that they are guaranteed 
to run the callback on the UI thread.

```scala
class Main extends Activity with AsyncActivity {

  override def onCreate(saved: Bundle): Unit = {
    super.onCreate(saved)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

    val tv = findViewById(R.id.tv1).asInstanceOf[TextView]

    ServerCalls.doCall.onCompleteForUi {
      case Success(result) => tv.setText(s"Success: $result")
      case Failure(ex)     => tv.setText(s"Failure: $ex")
    }
  }

}
```

Life is good.

Installation
------------

No, it's not on Maven Central. Take the file `app/libs/library.aar`, maybe rename it to `asyncactivity.aar`, and put 
it in your project's libs folder. Modify your build.gradle like such:

```Groovy
repositories {
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}
dependencies {
    compile(name:'asyncactivity', ext:'aar')
    // Other dependencies
}
```
